<h1><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Common Simulation Framework (CSF) -
User Guide</span></h1>

<p>Author: <a href="mailto:jcald1@NOSPAMREMOVEgmail">Jorge Calderon</a><br>
Release 0.1.0</p>

<p>Feb 21, 2015<br>
</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
The Common Simulation Framework has several goals:<br>

<ol>
  <li>Create a common interface to support Agent-based Modeling and Simulation
    tools such as <a href="http://repast.sourceforge.net/">Repast Simphony</a>
    to communicate with agents that exist outside of the simulation runtime.
    These distributed agents could be software agents that are part of a
    multi-agent system such as <a href="http://jade.tilab.com/">JADE</a>.  In
    this release we only support integration of JADE agents into
    Repast-Simphony-administered simulations. 
    <p>In the future it is expected that tools to model agents and other
    ABM-simulation software systems will be supported.  For example, <a
    href="http://jade.tilab.com/">JADE</a> or <a
    href="http://jacamo.sourceforge.net/">JaCaMo</a> agents, among other types
    of agents, could be used in <a href="http://repast.sourceforge.net/">Repast
    Simphony</a>, <a
    href="http://repast.sourceforge.net/repast_hpc.html">Repast HPC</a>, <a
    href="http://cs.gmu.edu/%7Eeclab/projects/mason/">MASON</a>, or <a
    href="https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/">NetLogo</a> simulations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Support the creation of competitive simulations/programming games for
    teaching and research.  For example, participants can create their own JADE
    agents that participate in a CSF-administered Prisoner's Dilemma simulation
    built with Repast Simphony.  The framework handles the pairing of
    participants and scorekeeping.  In many ways, the Common Simulation
    Framework acts as a game server in a video game, protecting the integrity
    of the simulation by programmatically limiting access to the global
    environment by individual agents.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ol>
  <li><a
    href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">JDK
    1.7+</a></li>
  <li>Windows, MacOSX, or *nix.  There are some scripts/batch files for
    starting the simulation, that have been created only for Windows so far.
     Each contains a small number of simple commands, which could be easily
    copied and pasted into a Linux/MacOS shell.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Installation</h2>
It's essential that all of the steps in the <a
href="../Install-ReadMe.html">Installation Instructions</a> be followed to
ensure proper installation of the CSF. The installation instructions are at the
root directory of the overall CSF project. 

<h2>Basic Concepts - Agent-based Modeling and Simulation</h2>

<p>It is recommended that the user starts with learning the basic concepts of
Agent-based modeling and simulation.  A <a
href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc09papers/009.pdf">good introductory guide
is here</a>.  Creating simulations for the Common Simulation Framework will
require knowledge of Repast Simphony.  The <a
href="http://repast.sourceforge.net/docs.php#">Repast Java Getting Started
Guide on this page </a>is a recommended starting place for Repast Simphony. The
reader should also familiarize him/herself with <a
href="http://jade.tilab.com/">JADE</a>, a multi-agent system for Java. Finally,
the user may want to read the abstract and introduction of the thesis upon
which this work is based. The location is in the Thesis subdirectory of this
git repository:
git@code.seas.harvard.edu:jcalderon-thesis/jcalderon-thesis-design.git (To be
moved to GitHub)</p>

<p></p>

<p>Beyond the basic general agent-based modeling background and specific
background for RepastS and JADE, we present a few concepts here that are
important for understanding how the CSF works.</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<h2>Basic Concepts - The Common Simulation Framework</h2>
There is much overlap in the areas of Agent-based modeling and simulation and
Multi-agent Systems.  In an effort to prevent misunderstandings of terms, we
define a common terminology here used throughout the common simulation
framework.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">How does the Common Simulation Framework
define and use the term "agent"?</span><br>
    In ABM, agents are autonomous actors in a model.  In multi-agent systems,
the term "agents" refers to autonomous <span
style="font-style: italic;">software agents</span>.  From a multi-agent systems
standpoint, the agents in Repast Simphony are not truly autonomous <span
style="font-style: italic;">software agents </span>as they are not autonomous
at the software implementation level, even though they represent autonomous
entities in an ABM model.   JADE agents, however, are truly autonomous software
agents.  They send out messages at will, receive messages, can even decide not
respond to messages received, and execute in their own threads of control. They
are subservient only to the administrative agents that are controlled by the
MAS administrator.  Sometimes Repast has been incorrectly referred to as
multi-agent system and it is important that we be precise here in our
terminology as we are attempting to combine both types of systems and wish to
avoid confusion.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Terms in the Common Simulation
Framework</span><br>
In the Common Simulation Framework, we try to always specify what type of agent
we are talking about.  We use the term "<span
style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">simulation agent"</span> to mean
an agent that runs in the simulation runtime, such as Repast agents.  Outside
of the simulation runtime, we have one to many<span
style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-style: italic;"><span
style="font-weight: bold;">distributed systems</span>.</span>  Distributed
systems can be thought of as synonymous with Multi-agent systems (MAS).  The
distinction in terms here is due to the fact that we are in the future striving
to support distributed systems that are not necessarily a MAS, in addition to
MASs like JADE.  Each distributed system/MAS may contain one to many <span
style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">distributed
autonomous software agents </span></span>or <span
style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">distributed
autonomous agents</span></span> for short<span
style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>.
 </span>In JADE, these would be the individual JADE agents.  We call them
"distributed" even if they are running on the same host as the Repast runtime.
They are distributed from the perspective of the simulation runtime (they are
running as separate non-Repast processes).  The reason we use the term
"distributed autonomous (software) agent" instead of "JADE agent" is that the
CSF will be supporting other types of MASs/distributed systems in the future
besides JADE, and so we prefer to use a standard term from the beginning.<br>
<br>
Typically, a distributed autonomous software agent or JADE agent would
correspond to one (simulation) agent on the Repast side. For example, in a
Prisoner's Dilemma, a participants creates a JADE agent to represent a Human
prisoner.  Repast doesn't understand JADE agent terminology and so there is a
representation of the JADE agent, implemented as a Human Repast (simulation)
agent object instance.  This Repast agent object instance must receive its
instructions from its distributed JADE agent counterpart.  So in this case
there is a one-to-one relationship between the Repast agent and the JADE
agent.<br>
<br>
However, we are building the Common Simulation Framework to be more robust than
this.  Instead of a competitive simulation/programming game such as Prisoner's
Dilemma, let's say that we wish to run a very large distributed ABM simulation
that's not a programming game and involves 100,000 simulation agents.  Creating
100,000 JADE agents would be too resource-intensive as each runs in a thread.
 Instead, we may wish each JADE agent to run or contain many agents
corresponding to simulations agents in the Repast/ABM.  Therefore, we use the
term "agent model" or "distributed agent model" to precisely identify the part
of the distributed autonomous agent/JADE agent that corresponds to a single
simulation agent in the ABM.<br>
<br>
From this perspective, a distributed autonomous software agent is simply
container for one to many agent models (usually it is just one agent
model).  The distributed autononmous agent itself is not of importance to the
ABM/Common Simulation Framework, other than being necessary to identify the
messages so that they may be routed to the appropriate agent model.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
style="font-style: italic;">Relationship between the Distributed Agent Model
and the Simulation Agent</span><br>
We can think of these two entities as jointly composing the <span
style="font-style: italic;">agent</span> in an ABM.  In a Common Simulation
Framework simulation, the simulation agent is dependent on its corresponding
distributed agent model for the decision making part of its behavior.  The
distributed autonomous agent model is dependent on its corresponding simulation
agent to retrieve the local environment information from the simulation
runtime, and to interact with other entities in the simulation runtime.
Therefore, the simulation agent and the distributed autonomous agent model on
their own form an incomplete ABM agent in CSF simulations.  On the other hand,
in a non-CSF simulation (JADE is not used), the simulation agent contains all
information in the model and is therefore a complete ABM agent.<br>
<br>
For a more thorough discussion of these concepts and the theoretical basis of
the Common Simulation Framework, please see the master's thesis proposal here.

<h2>Redis - The Common Interface and XML - The Platform Independent Data Format
for Message Exchange</h2>
One of the key benefits of the Common Simulation Framework over other
previously created agent-based systems integration efforts is that a common
platform and language independent interface has been created.  Instead of
having the various agent-based systems communicate directly with each other,
instead they must all communicate to the common interface.  This sets the stage
for greater interoperability in the future. For example, it would it theory be
possible to run multiple MASs at the same time communicating with an ABM
toolkit.  In addition, it would be possible to swap out one ABM toolkit for
another.<br>
<br>
Currently, only one interface option has been implemented.  It is the Redis
in-memory database, which allows storage of key-value pairs and lists.  XML is
used to encode and transmit data between the distributed systems and the
simulation runtime.  We therefore avoid use of direct Java references.  This
has a few benefits.  First, simulation authors are able to protect the
integrity of the simulation runtime in a competitive simulation or programming
game.  <span style="font-style: italic;">The view of the global environment is
programmatically hidden from the distributed agents.</span>  <span
style="font-style: italic;"></span>ABM tools are not typically written with
this requirement in mind.  Simulation authors must programmatically limit the
view of the global environment within each agent.  But what happens in a game
theory competition where the agent authors have an incentive to use as much
information as possible?  In the CSF, by creating a barrier between the
distributed agents and the simulation runtime, simulation authors are able to
easily create a level playing field in a competitive simulation such as a game
theory competitions for all (distributed) agent authors.<br>
<br>


<h2>Limitations and Recommendations in the Current Release</h2>
<ol>
  <li>A single distributed autonomous agent/JADE agent may only contain a
    single agent model, which corresponds to a single Repast agent.</li>
  <li>There can only be a single distributed system/MAS connected to the
    framework at any given time for any given simulation run.</li>
  <li>All JADE agents must reside on a single JADE platform.  This doesn't mean
    that all agents must be on the same host.  The framework currently uses
    local JADE names (AID or agent ID) for agent addressing and that is the
    reason for the single JADE Platform limitation.</li>
  <li>The JADE Controller Agent, which comes with the CSF, must be running on
    the same host as the Repast Simphony runtime.  This is because the two
    sides (RepastS and JADE) share information over a Redis in-memory
    database.  Future releases may include other interfaces such as web
    services, which would allow easing of this restriction.</li>
  <li>If the JADE agents are to be run in either separate processes or separate
    hosts from the JADE Controller Agent, The JADE Controller Agent must have
    permission to accept TCP connections from wherever the distributed JADE
    agents are running, typically on port 1099 although that value can be
    changed.  The JADE Controller Agent must also be able to establish TCP
    connections to each of the distributed JADE agents on separate TCP
    ports.  The security restrictions will vary widely but in one campus
    settings, it was found that the JADE agents could communicate with each
    other when the students ran their agents on their laptops while on the
    secure campus wireless network, instead of while on the insecure or visitor
    campus network.  The agents were also able to communicate with each other
    when being run on different computers in the same computer lab.  Finally,
    when running the agents on shared student Linux servers, the agents could
    communicate with each other only if the students first SSHed to the same
    Linux host.  Of course this is not guaranteed to be the case for all
    environments, but the scenarios above may provide the reader with some
    options. 
    <ul>
      <li>Note on running the JADE agents on shared Linux hosts, if each
        student were to run his/her agent under his/her own account, a new
        JVM/JADE container would be created and the server may quickly run out
        of memory.  It may be best for one person such as the professor or TF
        to run all of the agents under a single container, when using the
        option of running the agents on a shared server.  The JADE
        documentation contains some information on networking issues and
        solutions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The Common Simulation Framework currently only works while running the
    Repast simulation programmatically, using a version of TestMain as
    described in the <a
    href="http://repast.sourceforge.net/repast_3/how-to/faq.html">Repast
    FAQ</a>.  We call this application the Repast Simulation Runner.  Because
    the simulation is run programmatically, a GUI will not be displayed.   The
    simulation author should set up a data sink file (ModelOutput*.txt) to
    retrieve the results of the simulation runs.  The sample CSF Repast
    Simphony simulations already have the data sink files set up.  The
    ModelOutput files will be written to the Repast Simulation Runner
    directory, unlike when the simulations are run with the GUI, in which case
    the ModelOutput files are written to the Repast Simphony simulation project
    directory.  The same Repast simulation, if it not using the tournament
    feature of the framework, can be run as a regular Repast GUI simulation,
    assuming the Repast simulation code is set up to skip the common simulation
    framework functionality.</li>
  <li>All JADE agents must correspond to a single Repast class (different
    object instance of a single Repast class). In the future we may support
    JADE agents corresponding to different Repast classes.</li>
  <li>Multithreading of the Common Simulation Framework is not supported.
     However, support for concurrent executions of the Common Simulation
    Framework as separate processes using the same Redis cache will be
    supported in the future.</li>
  <li>The number of  JADE agents that need matching representations in Repast
    is fixed.  No such agents can be added after the CSF simulation has
    initialized and simulation execution started.  This does not apply to
    Repast agents that do not have matching JADE agents or JADE agents with no
    representations in Repast.</li>
  <li>The Common Simulation Framework Repast Simulation Runner uses a single
    thread to execute the simulations.  Messages are pulled from the Redis
    cache using polling.  Future releases may add an administrative thread per
    Redis key/channel so that true event-driven messaging can take place on the
    simulation side.</li>
  <li>No assurances are made about the use of the Common Simulation Framework
    with JADE LEAP. </li>
  <li>Limited error checking is provided by the framework.  It is suggested
    that the Repast Simulation Runner and JADE Controller Agents be run with
    assertions on.  Assertions have been added in a few places in the code
    (RepastS Simulation Runner, JADE Controller Agent, RepastS agents-reference
    implementations, JADE agents-reference implementations) as placeholders for
    better validation and error handling.  These processes should be run with
    the "-ea" JVM argument set to enable assertion checking, especially during
    the testing phase.  All of the Eclipse launchers for the CSF applications
    have this option set by default.</li>
  <li>The JADE Controller agent should be run either in the same JADE Container
    as the other JADE agents, or it should be run first. (Only the first
    scenario has been tested)</li>
  <li>The JADE Controller agent should run on in the main JADE container. (Only
    the first scenario has been tested)</li>
  <li>In programming game tournaments, if all JADE agents will be run in the
    same container, then each agent must use a different Java class name,
    otherwise there will be collision with the other players' JADE agents.</li>
  <li>Limitations to be removed shortly post March 2015: 
    <ol>
      <li>The number of corresponding JADE and Repast agents is fixed at 6 for
        JZombies and 8 for the Prisoner's Dilemma Tournament.</li>
      <li>Only the JZombies and Prisoner's Dilemma simulations are
      supported.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1>Important Information for Simulation Authors (Developers)</h1>
The Common Simulation Framework uses a default namespace (namespace at the root
element with no namespace qualifier/prefix) in the message exchange document.  
The root element is CsfMessageExchange.  The value of the default namespace is
currently: 
http://www.simulationsystems.org/csf/schemas/CsfMessageExchange/0.1.0 as
specified in the xmlns attribute in the root element.  Most elements, including
the root element, do not have a namespace qualifier or prefix (such as
"csf:").  CSF uses XPath to query the XML messages, however, XPath has no
support for default namespaces.  Therefore, CSF programmatically adds a "x:"
qualifier before <span style="text-decoration: underline;">querying </span>and
all queries of the XML must contain the "x:" namespace qualifier.  This becomes
important when creating methods to query or populate simulation-specific
elements.  If you follow the sample simulations examples, there should not be a
problem. <br>


<p>While most elements do not have a namespace qualifier, at times, when CSF
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">populates </span>sections of the XML,
it does add an "x:" qualifier and repeats the default namespace.  While this is
unnecessary in XML as it is semantically equivalent to leaving off the
qualifier and repeated namespace attribute, because all elements already belong
to the default namespace by default.  Again, if you follow the examples in the
sample simulations, you should be fine.  If you choose to use your own parsing
library, make sure your library is set to be namespace-aware.  CSF uses JDOM 2
for XML creation and parsing. </p>

<p></p>

<h1>Next Steps</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Execute the two reference implementations. Study the code in the RepastS
    simulation and JADE agents to understand how to combine the two using the
    CSF.</li>
  <li>Refer to the Javadocs in the <a href=".">Documentation</a> directory
    under the overall CSF project repository.</li>
