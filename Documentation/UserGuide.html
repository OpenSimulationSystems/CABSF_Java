<h1><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Common Agent-Based Simulation
Framework (CABSF) - User Guide</span></h1>

<p>Author: <a href="mailto:jcald1@NOSPAMREMOVEgmail">Jorge Calderon</a><br>
Release 0.2.0</p>

<p>July 9, 2015<br>
</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
The Common Agent-Based Simulation Framework has several goals:<br>

<ol>
  <li>Create a common interface to support Agent-based Modeling and Simulation
    tools such as <a href="http://repast.sourceforge.net/">Repast Simphony</a>
    to communicate with agents that exist outside of the simulation runtime.
    These distributed agents could be software agents that are part of a
    multi-agent system such as <a href="http://jade.tilab.com/">JADE</a>.  In
    this release we only support integration of JADE agents into
    Repast-Simphony-administered simulations. 
    <p>In the future it is expected that tools to model agents and other
    ABM-simulation software systems will be supported.  For example, <a
    href="http://jade.tilab.com/">JADE</a> or <a
    href="http://jacamo.sourceforge.net/">JaCaMo</a> agents, among other types
    of agents, could be used in <a href="http://repast.sourceforge.net/">Repast
    Simphony</a>, <a
    href="http://repast.sourceforge.net/repast_hpc.html">Repast HPC</a>, <a
    href="http://cs.gmu.edu/%7Eeclab/projects/mason/">MASON</a>, or <a
    href="https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/">NetLogo</a> simulations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Support the creation of competitive simulations/programming games for
    teaching and research.  For example, participants can create their own JADE
    agents that participate in a CABSF-administered Prisoner's Dilemma
    simulation built with Repast Simphony.  The framework handles the pairing
    of participants and scorekeeping.  In many ways, the Common Agent-Based
    Simulation Framework acts as a game server in a video game, protecting the
    integrity of the simulation by programmatically limiting access to the
    global environment by individual agents.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ol>
  <li><a
    href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">JDK
    1.7+</a></li>
  <li>Windows, MacOSX, or *nix.  There are some scripts/batch files for
    starting the simulation, that have been created only for Windows so far.
     Each contains a small number of simple commands, which could be easily
    copied and pasted into a Linux/MacOS shell.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Installation</h2>
It's essential that all of the steps in the <a
href="../Install-ReadMe.html">Installation Instructions</a> be followed to
ensure proper installation of the CABSF. The installation instructions are at
the root directory of the overall CABSF project. 

<h2>Basic Concepts - Agent-based Modeling and Simulation</h2>

<p>It is recommended that the user starts with learning the basic concepts of
Agent-based modeling and simulation.  A <a
href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc09papers/009.pdf">good introductory guide
is here</a>.  Creating simulations for the Common Agent-Based Simulation
Framework will require knowledge of Repast Simphony.  The <a
href="http://repast.sourceforge.net/docs.php#">Repast Java Getting Started
Guide on this page </a>is a recommended starting place for Repast Simphony. The
reader should also familiarize him/herself with <a
href="http://jade.tilab.com/">JADE</a>, a multi-agent system for Java. Finally,
the user may want to read the abstract and introduction of the thesis upon
which this work is based. The location is in the Thesis subdirectory of this
git repository: https://github.com/OpenSimulationSystems/CABSF_Java</p>

<p></p>

<p>Beyond the basic general agent-based modeling background and specific
background for RepastS and JADE, we present a few concepts here that are
important for understanding how the CABSF works.</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<h2>Basic Concepts - The Common Simulation Framework</h2>
There is much overlap in the areas of Agent-based modeling and simulation and
Multi-agent Systems.  In an effort to prevent misunderstandings of terms, we
define a common terminology here used throughout the common simulation
framework.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">How does the Common Agent-Based Simulation
Framework define and use the term "agent"?</span><br>
    In ABM, agents are autonomous actors in a model.  In multi-agent systems,
the term "agents" refers to autonomous <span
style="font-style: italic;">software agents</span>.  From a multi-agent systems
standpoint, the agents in Repast Simphony are not truly autonomous <span
style="font-style: italic;">software agents </span>as they are not autonomous
at the software implementation level, even though they represent autonomous
entities in an ABM model.   JADE agents, however, are truly autonomous software
agents.  They send out messages at will, receive messages, can even decide not
respond to messages received, and execute in their own threads of control. They
are subservient only to the administrative agents that are controlled by the
MAS administrator.  Sometimes Repast has been incorrectly referred to as
multi-agent system and it is important that we be precise here in our
terminology as we are attempting to combine both types of systems and wish to
avoid confusion.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Terms in the Common Simulation
Framework</span><br>
In the Common Simulation Framework, we try to always specify what type of agent
we are talking about.  We use the term "<span
style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">simulation agent"</span> to mean
an agent that runs in the simulation runtime, such as Repast agents.  Outside
of the simulation runtime, we have one to many<span
style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-style: italic;"><span
style="font-weight: bold;">distributed systems</span>.</span>  Distributed
systems can be thought of as synonymous with Multi-agent systems (MAS).  The
distinction in terms here is due to the fact that we are in the future striving
to support distributed systems that are not necessarily a MAS, in addition to
MASs like JADE.  Each distributed system/MAS may contain one to many <span
style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">distributed
autonomous software agents </span></span>or <span
style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">distributed
autonomous agents</span></span> for short<span
style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>.
 </span>In JADE, these would be the individual JADE agents.  We call them
"distributed" even if they are running on the same host as the Repast runtime.
They are distributed from the perspective of the simulation runtime (they are
running as separate non-Repast processes).  The reason we use the term
"distributed autonomous (software) agent" instead of "JADE agent" is that the
CABSF will be supporting other types of MASs/distributed systems in the future
besides JADE, and so we prefer to use a standard term from the beginning.<br>
<br>
Typically, a distributed autonomous software agent or JADE agent would
correspond to one (simulation) agent on the Repast side. For example, in a
Prisoner's Dilemma, a participants creates a JADE agent to represent a Human
prisoner.  Repast doesn't understand JADE agent terminology and so there is a
representation of the JADE agent, implemented as a Human Repast (simulation)
agent object instance.  This Repast agent object instance must receive its
instructions from its distributed JADE agent counterpart.  So in this case
there is a one-to-one relationship between the Repast agent and the JADE
agent.<br>
<br>
However, we are building the Common Agent-Based Simulation Framework to be more
robust than this.  Instead of a competitive simulation/programming game such as
Prisoner's Dilemma, let's say that we wish to run a very large distributed ABM
simulation that's not a programming game and involves 100,000 simulation
agents.  Creating 100,000 JADE agents would be too resource-intensive as each
runs in a thread.  Instead, we may wish each JADE agent to run or contain many
agents corresponding to simulations agents in the Repast/ABM.  Therefore, we
use the term "agent model" or "distributed agent model" to precisely identify
the part of the distributed autonomous agent/JADE agent that corresponds to a
single simulation agent in the ABM.<br>
<br>
From this perspective, a distributed autonomous software agent is simply
container for one to many agent models (usually it is just one agent
model).  The distributed autononmous agent itself is not of importance to the
ABM/Common Simulation Framework, other than being necessary to identify the
messages so that they may be routed to the appropriate agent model.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
style="font-style: italic;">Relationship between the Distributed Agent Model
and the Simulation Agent</span><br>
We can think of these two entities as jointly composing the <span
style="font-style: italic;">agent</span> in an ABM.  In a Common Agent-Based
Simulation Framework simulation, the simulation agent is dependent on its
corresponding distributed agent model for the decision making part of its
behavior.  The distributed autonomous agent model is dependent on its
corresponding simulation agent to retrieve the local environment information
from the simulation runtime, and to interact with other entities in the
simulation runtime. Therefore, the simulation agent and the distributed
autonomous agent model on their own form an incomplete ABM agent in CABSF
simulations.  On the other hand, in a non-CABSF simulation (JADE is not used),
the simulation agent contains all information in the model and is therefore a
complete ABM agent.<br>
<br>
For a more thorough discussion of these concepts and the theoretical basis of
the Common Simulation Framework, please see the master's thesis proposal here.

<h2>Redis - The Common Interface and XML - The Platform Independent Data Format
for Message Exchange</h2>
One of the key benefits of the Common Agent-Based Simulation Framework over
other previously created agent-based systems integration efforts is that a
common platform and language independent interface has been created.  Instead
of having the various agent-based systems communicate directly with each other,
instead they must all communicate to the common interface.  This sets the stage
for greater interoperability in the future. For example, it would it theory be
possible to run multiple MASs at the same time communicating with an ABM
toolkit.  In addition, it would be possible to swap out one ABM toolkit for
another.<br>
<br>
Currently, only one interface option has been implemented.  It is the Redis
in-memory database, which allows storage of key-value pairs and lists.  XML is
used to encode and transmit data between the distributed systems and the
simulation runtime.  We therefore avoid use of direct Java references.  This
has a few benefits.  First, simulation authors are able to protect the
integrity of the simulation runtime in a competitive simulation or programming
game.  <span style="font-style: italic;">The view of the global environment is
programmatically hidden from the distributed agents.</span>  <span
style="font-style: italic;"></span>ABM tools are not typically written with
this requirement in mind.  Simulation authors must programmatically limit the
view of the global environment within each agent.  But what happens in a game
theory competition where the agent authors have an incentive to use as much
information as possible?  In the CABSF, by creating a barrier between the
distributed agents and the simulation runtime, simulation authors are able to
easily create a level playing field in a competitive simulation such as a game
theory competitions for all (distributed) agent authors.<br>
<br>


<h2>Limitations in the Current Release</h2>

<p>The following limitations are described, in order of most important to least
important. Some of the more important limitations will be addresseed in future
releases.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The Common Agent-Based Simulation Framework currently only works while
    running the Repast simulation programmatically (a type of batch run), using
    a version of TestMain as described in the <a
    href="http://repast.sourceforge.net/repast_3/how-to/faq.html">Repast
    FAQ</a>.  We call this application the Repast Simulation Runner.  Because
    the simulation is run programmatically, a GUI will not be displayed.   The
    simulation author should set up a data sink file (ModelOutput*.txt) to
    retrieve the results of the simulation runs.  The sample CABSF Repast
    Simphony simulations already have the data sink files set up.  The
    ModelOutput files will be written to the Repast Simulation Runner
    directory, unlike when the simulations are run with the GUI, in which case
    the ModelOutput files are written to the Repast Simphony simulation project
    directory.  The CABSF Repast simulations can be run as regular Repast GUI
    simulation, but the CABSF features would be turned off.</li>
  <li>If the JADE agents are to be run on separate hosts from the JADE
    Controller Agent, The JADE Controller Agent must have permission to accept
    TCP connections from wherever the distributed JADE agents are running,
    typically on port 1099 although that value can be changed.  The JADE
    Controller Agent must also be able to establish separate TCP connections to
    each of the distributed JADE agents on separate TCP ports.  The security
    restrictions will vary widely but in one campus settings, it was found that
    the JADE agents could communicate with each other when the students
    ran their agents on their laptops while on the secure campus wireless
    network, instead of while on the insecure or visitor campus network.  The
    agents were also able to communicate with each other when being run on
    different computers in the same computer lab.  Finally, when running the
    agents on shared student Linux servers, the agents could communicate with
    each other only if the students first SSHed to the same Linux host.  Of
    course not all environments will be set up the same way, but the scenarios
    above may provide the reader with some options. 
    <ul>
      <li>Note on running the JADE agents on shared Linux hosts, if each
        student were to run his/her agent under his/her own account, a separate
        JVM/JADE container would be created and the server may quickly run out
        of memory.  It may be best for one person such as the professor or TF
        to run all of the agents under a single container, when using the
        option of running the agents on a shared server.  The JADE
        documentation contains some information on networking issues and
        solutions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Limited error checking is provided by the framework.  It is suggested
    that the Repast Simulation Runner and JADE Controller Agents, both
    components of the CABSF, be run with Java assertions on ("-ea" JVM
    argument).  Assertions have been added in the RepastS Simulation Runner,
    JADE Controller Agent, RepastS agents reference implementations, and JADE
    agents reference implementations.  All of the Eclipse launchers for the
    CABSF applications have this option set by default. More robust error
    handling may be added in the future.</li>
  <li>The Common Agent-Based Simulation Framework Repast Simulation Runner uses
    a single thread to execute the simulations.  Messages are pulled from the
    Redis cache using polling.  Future releases may add an administrative
    thread per Redis key/channel so that true event-driven messaging can take
    place on the simulation side.</li>
  <li>All Repast agents with corresponding JADE agents must be objects of the
    same Repaast class and all of those Repast objects must have corresponding
    JADE agents.</li>
  <li>Only JADE agents with representations in Repast should be started. There
    is currently no process to match the names of each JADE agent , as
    specified in the JADE program argument, with the JADE agent names specified
    in the configuration file which CABSF uses to map to the Repast agent
  names.</li>
  <li>A single distributed autonomous agent/JADE agent may only contain a
    single agent model corresponding to a single Repast agent (Repast class
    object). In the future we may support JADE agents corresponding to
    different Repast classes.</li>
  <li>There can only be a single distributed system/MAS connected to the
    framework at any given time for any given simulation run.</li>
  <li>All JADE agents with representations in Repast Simphony must reside on a
    single JADE platform.  This doesn't mean that all agents must be on the
    same host.  The framework currently uses local JADE names (AID or agent ID)
    for agent addressing and that is the reason for the single JADE Platform
    limitation.</li>
  <li>The JADE Controller Agent, which is a component of CABSF, must be running
    on the same host as the Repast Simphony runtime.  This is because the two
    sides (RepastS and JADE) share information over a Redis in-memory
    database.  Future releases may include other interfaces such as web
    services, which would allow easing of this restriction.</li>
  <li>The number of  JADE agents with matching representations in Repast is
    fixed at the start of execution and defined in the CABSF configuration
    file(s)  No such agents can be added after the CABSF simulation execution
    begins.  This does not apply to Repast agents with no matching JADE agents
    or JADE agents with no representations in Repast (However, see the current
    limitation on this scenario above).</li>
  <li>The distributed autonomous agent model names are hard coded to be the
    distributed autonomous agent name (JADE local name) plus "MODEL". This
    naming convention needs to be followed in the configuration file, until it
    is relaxed in the future.</li>
  <li>No assurances are made about the use of the Common Agent-Based Simulation
    Framework with JADE LEAP for execution on Android phones.</li>
  <li>It is best to start the JADE Controller Agent first as part of the JADE
    platform, and either include the other JADE agents in this single process,
    or start those other agents separately as a peripheral container after the
    main JADE platform has started. It may be possible to start the other
    agents as the JADE platform and start the JADE Controller Agent in a
    peripheral container, but this hasn't been tested.</li>
  <li>Setting the same pseudorandom seed in Repast Simphony simulations
    generates different results depending on whether the simulation is run with
    the GUI or in the programmatic/batch modes. Within each type of execution,
    the results are consistent in Repast Simphony version 2.3.1+. CABSF has no
    control over this limitation.</li>
  <li>Multithreading of the Common Agent-Based Simulation Framework is not
    supported.  Multithreading within RepastS agents should still be supported,
    but has not been tested out. Multithreading of JADE agents is not
    recommended, per the JADE documentation. Support for concurrent executions
    of the Common Agent-Based Simulation Framework as separate processes using
    the same Redis cache may be supported in the future.</li>
</ol>

<h1>XML</h1>
The Common Agent-Based Simulation Framework uses a default namespace (namespace
at the root element with no namespace qualifier/prefix) in the message exchange
document.   The root element is CABSFMessageExchange.  The value of the default
namespace is currently: 
http://www.simulationsystems.org/CABSF/schemas/CABSFMessageExchange/0.1.0 as
specified in the xmlns attribute in the root element.  Most elements, including
the root element, do not have a namespace qualifier or prefix (such as
"CABSF:").  CABSF uses XPath to query the XML messages, however, XPath has no
support for default namespaces.  Therefore, CABSF programmatically adds a "x:"
qualifier before <span style="text-decoration: underline;">querying </span>and
all queries of the XML must contain the "x:" namespace qualifier.  This becomes
important when creating methods to query or populate simulation-specific
elements.  If you follow the sample simulations examples, there should not be a
problem. <br>


<p>While most elements do not have a namespace qualifier, at times, when CABSF
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">populates </span>sections of the XML,
it does add an "x:" qualifier and repeats the default namespace.  While this is
unnecessary in XML as it is semantically equivalent to leaving off the
qualifier and repeated namespace attribute, because all elements already belong
to the default namespace by default.  Again, if you follow the examples in the
sample simulations, you should be fine.  If you choose to use your own parsing
library, make sure your library is set to be namespace-aware.  CABSF uses JDOM
2 for XML creation and parsing. </p>

<p></p>

<h1>Next Steps</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Execute the two reference implementations. Study the code in the RepastS
    simulation and JADE agents to understand how to combine the two using the
    CABSF.</li>
  <li>Refer to the Javadocs in the <a href=".">Documentation</a> directory
    under the overall CABSF project repository.</li>
</ol>

<p>When starting JADE, if you see an error such as:</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">WARNING: Error adding ICP
jade.imtp.leap.JICP.JICPPeer@1806e9d2[Cannot bind server socket to localhost
port 1099].</span></p>

<p>it probably means that you already have a JADE process running. Kill the
existing process (hit the red square in Eclipse for all JADE processes). You
may want to clear the Redis cache then restart the simulation process as
well.</p>
