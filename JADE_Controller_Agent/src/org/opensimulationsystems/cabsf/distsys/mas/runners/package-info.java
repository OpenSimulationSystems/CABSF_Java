/**
 * CABSF adapter implementations for distributed systems. Communication with the CABSF
 * Distributed System API is based on the specific system.  Those specific systems, such as JADE use
 * a child package.  For example, for JADE, communication using the CABSF is performed through the JADE MAS
 * using the CABSF JADE API.  The implementor of this JADE-specific API is in the jade child package.
