/**
 * CSF adapter implementations for distributed systems. Communication with the CSF
 * Distributed System API is based on the specific system.  Those specific systems, such as JADE use
 * a child package.  For example, for JADE, communication using the CSF is performed through the JADE MAS
 * using the CSF JADE API.  The implementor of this JADE-specific API is in the jade child package.
