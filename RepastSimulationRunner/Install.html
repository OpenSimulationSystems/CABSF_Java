<h1><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Common
Simulation Framework Installation Instructions</span></h1>
Author: <a href="mailto:jcald1@gmail.com">Jorge Calderon</a><br>
Release 0.1.TBD<br>
11/19/2014<br>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ol>
<li>JDK 1.7 recommended (TBD: determine minimum version
supported)</li><li>Windows, MacOSX, or *nix (The instructions assume Windows for now)</li></ol>
<h2>Third Party Software Downloads<br></h2>Download and install the following software<ol><li><a href="http://repast.sourceforge.net/download.html">Repast
Simphony (Java version)</a></li><li>(Future, not needed with present version):<a href="http://jade.tilab.com/download/jade/"> JADE</a></li><li><a href="http://redis.io/download">Redis</a></li><li><a href="http://www.git-scm.com/downloads">git</a>
to pull the code</li></ol>Add redis-server, redis-cli, and git to your environment path variable.<br><br>It
is possible run the Common Simulation Framework without the full Repast
Simphony IDE, either using the command line or with a general Eclipse
distribution. However, the instructions here assume that the Repast
Simphony customization of the eclipse IDE will be used to run the
Common Simulation framework, the distributed systems (Multi-agent
systems) and distributed agent models.<br>
<h2>Installation Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Download and install Repast Simphony (Java Version), Redis,
and
git.<br>
</li>
<li>Download the Common Simulation Framework Code (To be moved
to GitHub)</li>
<ol>
<li>Log on to code.seas.harvard.edu with your Harvard id.</li>
<li>Clone this repository:
git@code.seas.harvard.edu:jcalderon-thesis/jcalderon-thesis.git</li>
<li>Go to the project page: <a href="https://code.seas.harvard.edu/jcalderon-thesis/jcalderon-thesis">https://code.seas.harvard.edu/jcalderon-thesis/jcalderon-thesis</a></li>
<li>Copy the git URL and clone it on your local machine using
this command: git clone
git@code.seas.harvard.edu:jcalderon-thesis/jcalderon-thesis.git</li>
</ol>
<li>Install <span style="font-weight: bold;">JZombies_CSF_Demo</span></li>
<ol>
<li>While this simulation comes with the Repast samples
(File-Import-Repast Simphony-Import Repast Example Models), the CSF
version is needed as it includes code to connect to the CSF.
&nbsp;The name of the project/directory is JZombies_CSF_Demo.</li>
<ol>
<li>File-Import-New-Java Project-Unselect Default
location-Select the JZombies_CSF_Demo<span style="font-weight: bold;">
</span>project-Next-Finish</li>
<li>Click the down arrow next to the green "Run" button.
&nbsp;Verify that Repast Simphony/Eclipse has created a run
configuration for&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">JZombies_CSF_Demo
</span>simulation.</li>
<li>Right click on the project name on the left side,
Repast Simphony, Add Repast Simphony Nature.</li>
<li>Click the simulation in the drop down list
for JZombies_CSF_Demo.</li>
<li>If you see an error when using Windows, such as
"WARNING: Could not
open/create prefs root node Software\JavaSoft\Prefs at root 0x80000002.
Windows RegCreateKeyEx(...) returned error code 5." in the eclipse
console window, you can implement the fix described <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16428098/groovy-shell-warning-could-not-open-create-prefs-root-node">here</a>,
but is not necessary.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The Repast GUI should pop up after a few seconds.</li>
<li>Run the simulation by clicking on the blue run button.
&nbsp;You should see the image on the right of zombies catching
humans. &nbsp;The ticks should increment by 1s.</li>
<li>The
Repast "<a href="http://repast.sourceforge.net/docs.php">Getting
Started guide</a>" is a great place to start for learning Repast.
&nbsp;Even if you don't plan to create your own simulations, browse
through the instructions so you learn&nbsp; the directory
structure, parameters, and how to use the GUI.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<li>Open Repast Simphony (Eclipse) and create a separate new
Java
Project for these projects under the cloned local repo (File-New-Java
Project), unselect "Use default location", browse to each directory in
the list below.&nbsp;</li>
<ol>
<li>RepastSimulationRunner</li>
<ol>
<li>Create a new Java Proejct for RepastSimulationRunner.</li>
</ol>
<li>CSF_JADE_Controller_Agent</li>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOTE</span>:
&nbsp;The CSF_JADE_Controller_Agent will become a become a
JADE agent in the future. For now, it is a standalone Java program that
holds mock Human agents for the simulation.
<br>
</ol>
<li>Right click on the RepastSimulationRunner project-Build
Path-Projects, and select the&nbsp;JZombies_CSF_Demo project.</li><li>Click on the libraries tab, select add JARs, and select all of the JARs in the&nbsp;RepastSimulationRunner/lib folder and its subfolders.</li><li>Click on the libraries tab, Add External JARs, and select
the "repast.simphony.bin_and_src.jar", which is in your <span style="font-weight: bold;">{Repast_Installation}/eclipse/plugins
</span>directory.</li><li>While still in the External JARs directory, select all of the JARs in the RepastSimulationRunner/lib directory.</li><li>Add all of the External JARS in the following
directory:&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">{Repast_Installation}/eclipse/plugins/repast.simphony.runtime_2.1.0/lib</span></li><li>Click "OK".</li><li>Right click on&nbsp;CSF_JADE_Controller_Agent, click on project-Build Path-Libraries. &nbsp;Select add External JARs, and select all of the JARs in the&nbsp;RepastSimulationRunner/lib folder and its subfolders.</li><li>Open
the launchers folder, right click on RepastSimulationRunner -
CSF.launch, right click on "Run As", click "RepastSimulationRunner -
CSF.launch"
. &nbsp;Next time you should see it in the drop down next to the run
button.
&nbsp;You should see an error message initially as Redis has not been
started. &nbsp;The configuration in eclilpse is now complete.</li>
<ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<h2>Simulation Execution</h2>
<ol><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Start up all of the Processes</span></li><ol><li>Start
the Redis server by opening the launcher folder, selecting the
appropriate subfolder for your operating system, and double clicking on
"redis-server". &nbsp; If it opens as a text file, right click it, open
with, default editor. &nbsp; (TODO: Create another version for
Linux/MacOS for each of these files).&nbsp;Keep a separate
terminal window open for Redis and watch for error messages.
&nbsp;Alternatively, in Windows, Redis can be installed as a service. </li><li>Optionally,
run a separate terminal window for the redis command line "redis-cli".
&nbsp;This allows you to inspect messages. &nbsp;For example, if you
shut down or pause the distributed system(s), you can checkto see what
message the simulation engine (Repast) is trying to send those systems.
</li><ol><li>Useful
commands include "KEYS *" to see all messages, "lpop thechannelname" to
pop a value from the list. &nbsp;Note, that these messaging structures
may be changed in the future to apublish/subscribe model, which would require a different command to read the messages. </li></ol><li>Navigate to the launchers folder and double click on
"startSimulation.bat". &nbsp; You should see that the
RepastSimulationRunner, using the Simulation side of the CSF begins to
process the simulation.</li><li>Click
on the drop down next to the run button and select
RepastSimulationRunner - CSF. &nbsp;You should see in the console that
the Common Simulation Framework is polling the
Redis
in-memory cache for commands from you, the simulation administrator.</li><li>Start up the distributed system(s)</li></ol>
<li style="font-weight: bold;">Kick off the Simulation</li><ol><li>All
of the processes are running now. &nbsp;The distributed system(s) are
waiting on the simulation engine and as mentioned already, the
simulation engine is waiting on you, the simulation administrator.</li><li>Start
the simulation run(s) by ipassing a START_SIMULATION command to the
simulation engine. &nbsp;Double click on startSimulationRuns.bat to do
so.</li><li>If you terminate the simulation early, make sure to flush the Redis cache by clicking on flushRedisCache.bat. &nbsp;</li></ol>
